This is the code we wrote for the Cedarville Programming Contest in 2024.
I worked on this with Joshua McKinniss, and the contest lasted from 10:30am to 3:30pm.
We were able to solve 7/10 of the problems, and so did 3 other teams but we solved that many first and so we won!
The problem we did not complete in here is the monk.java problem.

This also includes the 3 practice problems we completed:
abc.java
mixedfractions.java
mastermind.java

Have fun parsing!
